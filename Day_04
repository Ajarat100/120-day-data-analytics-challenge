# Day 4 of 120 – Regression Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

Today focused on two core statistical concepts in data analytics: **Regression Analysis** and **Hypothesis Testing**. Both are foundational for making data-driven decisions, especially when moving beyond description into explanation, prediction, and validation.

#  Regression Analysis Made Simple

## What is Regression Analysis?

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between variables.

At its core, regression answers questions like:

- Does one variable influence another?
- If X changes, what happens to Y?
- Can we predict an outcome based on known factors?

In most business and analytical contexts, regression is used to model how a dependent variable (the outcome we care about) changes when one or more independent variables (the predictors) change.

For example:
- How do advertising costs affect sales?
- How does study time affect exam scores?
- How do interest rates affect investment returns?

Regression does not automatically prove causation, but it helps quantify relationships and measure strength of influence.

## Types of Regression

### 1. Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression examines the relationship between **one independent variable (X)** and **one dependent variable (Y)**.

It follows the form:

\[
Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε
\]

Where:
- **Y** = dependent variable (outcome)
- **X** = independent variable (predictor)
- **β₀** = intercept
- **β₁** = slope (effect of X on Y)
- **ε** = error term

Example:
- Predicting sales based only on advertising spend.
- Estimining exam score based on hours studied.

The slope tells us how much Y changes when X increases by one unit.

### 2. Multiple Regression

Multiple regression extends the idea by including **two or more independent variables**.

It follows the form:

\[
Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βnXn + ε
\]

This allows analysis of how several factors influence an outcome at the same time.

Example:
- Predicting house price based on size, location, and number of bedrooms.
- Estimating sales using price, advertising budget, season, and competitor activity.

Multiple regression helps isolate the effect of each variable while controlling for others.

## Why Regression Matters in Data Analytics

Regression is important because it:

- Helps explain relationships between variables
- Supports prediction of future outcomes
- Quantifies the strength and direction of influence
- Assists decision-making based on measurable patterns

Instead of guessing what might be driving a result, regression provides a structured way to test and model influence.

## Real-World Applications of Regression

### E-commerce

- Predicting sales based on advertising spend
- Estimining customer lifetime value
- Understanding how price changes affect demand
- Forecasting revenue trends

Regression helps businesses optimize marketing spend and pricing strategies.

---

### Finance

- Modeling stock returns based on market factors
- Estimating risk exposure
- Predicting loan default probability
- Understanding relationships between interest rates and investments

Regression allows financial analysts to assess influence and forecast financial performance.

---

### Healthcare

- Studying how lifestyle factors affect health outcomes
- Predicting disease risk based on patient characteristics
- Measuring treatment effectiveness
- Modeling hospital readmission rates

Healthcare analytics relies on regression to improve patient care and resource allocation.

#  Hypothesis Testing in Data Analytics

## What is Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in data to support a specific claim.

It provides a structured way to decide whether an observed result is likely due to:

- A real effect  
or  
- Random chance  

Rather than relying on intuition, hypothesis testing follows a formal decision-making process.

---

## Types of Hypotheses

### 1. Null Hypothesis (H₀)

The null hypothesis assumes:

- No effect
- No difference
- No relationship

It represents the default position.

Example:
- A new marketing campaign has no effect on sales.
- There is no difference between two product versions.
- There is no relationship between exercise and blood pressure.

---

### 2. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)

The alternative hypothesis assumes:

- There is an effect
- There is a difference
- There is a relationship

It represents what we are trying to find evidence for.

Example:
- The marketing campaign increases sales.
- Product A performs better than Product B.
- Exercise reduces blood pressure.

---

## The Process of Hypothesis Testing

1. **State the hypotheses**
   - Define the null and alternative hypotheses clearly.

2. **Choose a significance level (α)**
   - Commonly 0.05 (5%)
   - This represents the acceptable risk of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis).

3. **Select the appropriate statistical test**
   - t-test
   - z-test
   - chi-square test
   - ANOVA
   - etc.

4. **Calculate the test statistic and p-value**
   - The p-value measures how likely the observed result is if the null hypothesis is true.

5. **Make a decision**
   - If p-value ≤ α → Reject the null hypothesis.
   - If p-value > α → Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Important: Failing to reject the null does not prove it is true. It only means there is insufficient evidence against it.

## Why Hypothesis Testing Matters

Hypothesis testing is essential because it:

- Reduces decision-making based on assumptions
- Protects businesses from acting on weak evidence
- Provides a structured, objective framework
- Helps evaluate experiments (A/B testing)
- Supports risk-aware decision-making

Businesses rarely act on “it looks better.” They act when evidence is statistically strong enough to justify change.

# Key Reflection

Regression and hypothesis testing serve different but connected purposes:

- Regression helps answer:  
  **What is influencing this outcome?**  
  **How strongly?**  
  **Can it be predicted?**

- Hypothesis testing helps answer:  
  **Is this change real or just random variation?**  
  **Is there enough evidence to act?**

Both methods reduce costly mistakes by encouraging structured thinking over intuition.

In data analytics, asking the right question is just as important as running the right test.
