# Day 11 of 120 with Tina Okonkwo – Excel for Data Analytics (Charts)

Still on Excel this week.

Today’s focus was on charts and data visualization.

## What Are Charts?

Charts are visual representations of data. Instead of reading through rows and columns, charts allow patterns, trends, comparisons, and relationships to be seen more quickly and clearly.

They transform numerical data into visual insights.

## Why Do We Use Charts?

- To identify trends over time.
- To compare categories.
- To show proportions within a whole.
- To reveal relationships between variables.
- To make insights easier to communicate.

Charts simplify interpretation, especially for non-technical audiences.

## Types of Charts Explored

### Line Chart
Used to display trends over time. Best for continuous data such as monthly revenue or daily website traffic.

### Pie Chart
Shows proportions of a whole. Useful for simple percentage breakdowns, though it can become less effective with too many categories.

### Scatter Plot
Displays the relationship between two numerical variables. Useful for identifying correlations or patterns between variables.

### Map Chart
Represents geographic data visually. Useful when location plays a role in the analysis.

### Treemap Chart
Displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles. Helpful for showing category breakdowns within larger groups.

## When to Use Different Charts

The choice of chart depends on the story the data needs to tell:

- Use line charts for trends.
- Use bar or column charts for comparisons.
- Use scatter plots for relationships.
- Use pie charts for simple proportions.
- Use maps when geography matters.
- Use treemaps for hierarchical breakdowns.

The key insight today: the same dataset can communicate different messages depending on the visualization selected.

Charts are not just decorative elements added after analysis. They shape interpretation.

Still Excel — but now thinking about how data communicates, not just how it calculates.
