# Day 9 of 120 – Excel for Data Analytics (Continuation)

Today was focused on understanding the foundations of Excel more deeply.

## 1. What Are Formulas?

A formula in Excel is an expression that performs calculations on data. It combines values, cell references, and operators.

### Math Operators
Used to perform arithmetic calculations:
- `+` Addition  
- `-` Subtraction  
- `*` Multiplication  
- `/` Division  
- `^` Exponentiation  

### Comparison Operators
Used to compare values and return TRUE or FALSE:
- `=` Equal to  
- `>` Greater than  
- `<` Less than  
- `>=` Greater than or equal to  
- `<=` Less than or equal to  
- `<>` Not equal to  

### Cell Referencing

Cell references tell Excel where to get values from.

- **Relative Reference (A1):** Changes when copied to another cell.
- **Absolute Reference ($A$1):** Locks both the column and row so it does not change when copied.
- **Mixed Reference ($A1 or A$1):** Locks either the column or the row.

Understanding referencing is important when building reusable formulas across rows and columns.

## 2. What Are Functions?

Functions are predefined formulas built into Excel that perform specific tasks.  
They help simplify calculations and reduce errors.

### Why Use Functions?
- Save time  
- Reduce manual calculations  
- Improve consistency  
- Handle complex logic efficiently  

Functions are grouped into categories such as Logical, Math, Statistical, Text, and more.

## 3. Logical Functions

Logical functions allow Excel to make decisions based on conditions.

### Why Are Logical Functions Needed?
They help categorize, evaluate, and automate decision-making within datasets.

### Examples:

- **IF:** Returns one value if a condition is TRUE and another if FALSE.
- **Nested IF:** Multiple IF statements combined to test several conditions.
- **AND:** Returns TRUE if all conditions are TRUE.
- **OR:** Returns TRUE if at least one condition is TRUE.
- **IFS:** Tests multiple conditions without deeply nesting IF statements.

These are useful for grading systems, performance remarks, data classification, etc.

## 4. Math Functions

Math functions perform calculations and aggregations.

### Counting Functions
- **COUNT:** Counts cells with numbers.
- **COUNTA:** Counts non-empty cells.
- **COUNTIF:** Counts cells that meet one condition.
- **COUNTIFS:** Counts cells that meet multiple conditions.

### Summation Functions
- **SUM:** Adds numbers.
- **SUMIF:** Adds numbers based on one condition.
- **SUMIFS:** Adds numbers based on multiple conditions.

### Average Functions
- **AVERAGE:** Calculates mean.
- **AVERAGEIF:** Average based on one condition.
- **AVERAGEIFS:** Average based on multiple conditions.

### Minimum & Maximum
- **MIN:** Smallest value.
- **MINIFS:** Smallest value based on condition(s).
- **MAX:** Largest value.
- **MAXIFS:** Largest value based on condition(s).

Conditional functions (IF/IFS versions) are especially useful in real-world datasets.

## 5. Statistical Functions

Statistical functions summarize and describe data distribution.

- **Mean:** Average value of a dataset.
- **Median:** Middle value when data is sorted.
- **Mode:** Most frequent value.
- **Standard Deviation:** Measures how spread out values are from the mean.
- **Quartiles:**
  - Q1 (1st Quartile): 25th percentile
  - Q2 (2nd Quartile): Median (50th percentile)
  - Q3 (3rd Quartile): 75th percentile

These functions help understand distribution, variability, and central tendency in data.

## Reflection

Today helped me see Excel not just as a spreadsheet tool, but as a system that combines logic, mathematics, and statistics to analyze data.

Still learning. Still building.
