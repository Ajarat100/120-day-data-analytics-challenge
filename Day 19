## Day 19 — Advanced Power Query & M Language

Today I advanced into complex Power Query transformations and explored the M language to automate and optimize workflows.

### Transformations

- **Add Index Column:**  
  Created index columns to prepare the salary dataset for skill-level analysis, allowing easy row referencing.

- **Duplicate vs Reference Queries:**  
  Learned the difference:  
  - **Duplicate:** Creates a copy independent of the original query.  
  - **Reference:** Creates a query that dynamically links to the original, inheriting its changes.  
  Used these to create a dedicated skill query without modifying the main salary data.

- **Split & Unpivot Columns:**  
  Transformed the “job_skill” column from a multi-value field into a structured format suitable for aggregation.

- **Group By:**  
  Aggregated top skills across job postings to determine which skills were most frequent in the dataset.

- **Conditional Columns:**  
  Applied logic to clean and categorize skill data for final analysis.

### Appending and Merging Queries

- **Append Queries:** Combined monthly job postings into a single consolidated dataset.

- **Merge Queries:** Merged the “data_jobs_skills” dataset with the “data_jobs_salary” dataset for skill-based salary analysis.

- **Join Types:** Learned six types of joins (Left, Right, Inner, Full Outer, Anti, and Semi) and their applications in Power Query.

### M Language

- Explored the **Advanced Editor** in Power Query.  
- Learned the **`let` and `in` keywords** to define sequential transformations.  
- Every applied step references the previous one, ensuring workflows are deterministic.  
- Column names require **double quotes** `""` in the code.  
- Created **Custom Columns** using IF statements and other logic.  
- Reordered applied steps to optimize workflow and maintain accuracy.

### Final Analysis

- Conducted salary analysis for the **top 10 skills**.  
- Visualized results using a **clustered combo chart** to show skill demand versus average salary.  
- These transformations allowed insights into skill trends and compensation patterns across roles.

### Reflection

Day 19 reinforced that Power Query is not just about cleaning data—it’s about **building repeatable, scalable workflows** that prepare data for meaningful analysis.  

I learned that every step in data prep must logically feed into the next, and M language provides powerful ways to automate and customize transformations.  

Power Query + M = efficiency, scalability, and better insights from data.
