## Day 17 — Advanced Data Analysis in Excel

Today’s focus was on moving beyond summarizing data and starting to explore possible outcomes using Excel’s advanced analytical tools.

### Enabling Add-ins

I enabled:

- Analysis ToolPak  
- Solver Add-in  

These tools allowed me to perform deeper statistical and scenario-based analysis using the salary dataset.

### Forecasting & Scenario Analysis

Using Excel’s built-in tools, I explored how data can be used to model future possibilities.

- **Forecast Sheet**  
  Used to predict potential job posting trends for the next year.

- **Scenario Manager**  
  Modeled how total compensation could change over four years under different assumptions.

- **Goal Seek**  
  Helped determine the annual raise required to reach a specific salary target.

- **Solver**  
  Calculated the adjustment needed to match a defined compensation goal.

### Data Tables

I worked with:

- **One-input data tables**  
  To understand how a single variable affects salary outcomes.

- **Two-input data tables**  
  To explore how raise and bonus changes interact and influence salary.

### Analysis ToolPak

Using the Analysis ToolPak, I performed exploratory analysis on the salary dataset:

- **Descriptive statistics**  
  To summarize the overall salary distribution.

- **Histogram**  
  To visualize the spread of salary values.

- **Rank & Percentile**  
  To compare salary positions within the dataset.

- **Moving Average**  
  To smooth job posting trends and reduce seasonality.

### Reflection

Today felt like a shift from analyzing what already exists to exploring what could happen.

Instead of only asking:

> What does the data show?

I started asking:

> What would need to change?

This was my first step into using data not just for understanding the past, but for testing future scenarios.
