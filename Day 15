## Day 15 – Building an Interactive Salary Dashboard in Excel

Today I built an interactive Salary Dashboard using a real 2023 data jobs dataset containing 32,000+ records.

### Project Goal
The objective was to analyze median salaries based on:
- Job title
- Country
- Job schedule type

The final output was an interactive dashboard that updates dynamically based on user-selected filters.

## What I Learned

### 1. Structured Tables Change Everything

Converting raw data into structured Excel tables made referencing cleaner and more dynamic.

Instead of static cell references, I worked with structured references like:

jobs[salary_year_avg]

This reduced errors and made formulas easier to scale.

---

### 2. Multi-Criteria Median with Array Logic

I used a multi-criteria `MEDIAN(IF())` array formula to calculate salary insights based on:

- Selected job title
- Selected country
- Selected schedule type
- Excluding zero salary values

This required layering logical conditions inside a single formula.

This was one of the biggest conceptual shifts:
Instead of calculating one value, I was filtering a dataset inside a formula before aggregating it.

### 3. FILTER() and SEARCH() for Cleaning & Refinement

To refine job schedule types, I used:

- `FILTER()` to dynamically extract relevant values
- `SEARCH()` combined with `ISNUMBER()` to identify matching text patterns

This helped clean inconsistent or mixed schedule labels.

It reinforced that text data often needs logical handling before analysis.

---

### 4. Data Validation for Interactivity

I built dropdown menus using data validation.

These dropdowns controlled:
- The selected job title
- The selected country
- The selected schedule type

The selections fed directly into formulas, which then updated charts automatically.

This is where the dashboard became interactive rather than static.

---

### 5. Connecting Calculations to Visualizations

The dashboard included:
- A horizontal bar chart for salary comparison by role
- A map chart to visualize median salaries by country

This required ensuring:
- Aggregated calculations were accurate
- Named ranges or references were correctly linked
- Charts responded dynamically to selection inputs

This was the moment it stopped feeling like separate Excel skills and started feeling like system design.

## Technical Challenges

### Excel Version Limitation

Initially, I was using Excel 2019.

Functions like:
- `UNIQUE()`
- `SORT()`
- `FILTER()`

were not available.

After troubleshooting, I realized these functions require newer versions of Excel.

I temporarily switched between desktop and Excel Online before eventually moving to a Microsoft 365 free trial to access full functionality.

### Environmental Constraints

While troubleshooting version issues, I also dealt with:
- Laptop overheating from extended usage
- Electricity interruptions

This slowed progress but forced me to think about practical adaptability when working on projects.

---

## Key Shift in Thinking

Earlier Excel lessons were about learning functions.

This project was about:

- Structuring logic
- Connecting sheets
- Designing input-output flow
- Ensuring interactivity
- Debugging systematically

It felt like a move from “using tools” to “building analytical systems.”

## Reflection

Day 15 reinforced that building dashboards isn’t about visuals first.

It’s about logic, structure, and flow.

The visuals are just the final layer.
