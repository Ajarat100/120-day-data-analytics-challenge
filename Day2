This document captures what I learned today as part of my **120-day data analytics challenge**. The focus was on understanding how data is summarized using measures of **central tendency** and **spread**, what they mean, how they are calculated, and why they matter in real-world situations.
# Day 2 – Descriptive statistics for Data Analytics

##They are two main categories
* Measures of Central Tendency 
* Measures of Spread

## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency describe the *center* or *typical value* of a dataset. They help answer the question: **“What does a typical value look like?”**

The three main measures of central tendency are:

* Mean
* Median
* Mode

---

### Mean

The **mean** is the average of all numbers

**Definition:**
The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values.

**How it is calculated:**

1. Add all the numbers together
2. Divide the total by how many numbers there are

**Example:**
If salaries are: 50, 60, 70
Mean = (50 + 60 + 70) ÷ 3 = 60

**Real-world applications:**

* Average test scores in a class
* Average daily sales or revenue
* Average temperature over a period of time

**Important note:**
The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers). Very large or very small numbers can pull the mean up or down.

---

### Median

The **median** represents the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in order.

**Definition:**
The median is the value that separates the higher half and lower half of a dataset.

**How it is calculated:**

1. Arrange the values in ascending order
2. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle number
3. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers

**Example:**
Data: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
Median = 30

**Real-world applications:**

* Household income statistics
* Property prices
* Any data where outliers are common

**Why it matters:**
The median is less affected by extreme values and often gives a better sense of a "typical" value when data is skewed.

---

### Mode

The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

**Definition:**
The mode is the most common value.

**How it is calculated:**

1. Count how often each value appears
2. Identify the value with the highest frequency

**Example:**
Data: 2, 3, 3, 5, 7
Mode = 3

**Real-world applications:**

* Most common shoe size sold
* Most frequent customer complaint
* Popular product categories

**Important note:**
A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.

## Measures of Spread

Measures of spread describe how **spread out** or **varied** the data is. They answer the question: **“How much do the values differ from each other?”**

The three main measures of spread are:

* Range
* Standard Deviation
* Interquartile Range (IQR)

---

### Range

The **range** shows the simplest form of spread in a dataset.

**Definition:**
The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.

**How it is calculated:**

1. Identify the maximum value
2. Identify the minimum value
3. Subtract the minimum from the maximum

Range= Minimum value - Maximum value

**Example:**
Data: 10, 20, 50
Range = 50 − 10 = 40

**Real-world applications:**

* Temperature variation in a day
* Price differences of products

**Limitation:**
The range is highly affected by outliers and does not show how values are distributed between the extremes.

---

### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation measures how far values tend to be from the mean.

**Definition:**
Standard deviation shows the average distance of data points from the mean.

**How it is calculated (conceptually):**

1. Find the mean
2. Calculate how far each value is from the mean
3. Square those differences
4. Find the average of the squared differences
5. Take the square root

**Real-world applications:**

* Financial market volatility
* Quality control in manufacturing
* Performance consistency analysis

**Why it matters:**
A low standard deviation means data points are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates greater variability.

---

### Interquartile Range (IQR)

The **interquartile range** focuses on the middle portion of the data.

**Definition:**
IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1).

**How it is calculated:**

1. Arrange data in ascending order
2. Find Q1 (25th percentile)
3. Find Q3 (75th percentile)
4. Subtract Q1 from Q3

Interquartile range= Q1 -Q2

**Example:**
If Q1 = 20 and Q3 = 60
IQR = 60 − 20 = 40

**Real-world applications:**

* Income and salary analysis
* Identifying outliers
* Understanding the spread of the central 50% of data

**Why it matters:**
IQR is resistant to outliers and provides a more reliable measure of spread for skewed data.

## Key Takeaway

* Measures of central tendency explain where data is centered.
* Measures of spread explain how data is distributed around that center.
* Understanding both is necessary to correctly interpret data and avoid misleading conclusions.

This lesson reinforced that summary statistics are most meaningful when used together, not in isolation.
