# Day 10 of 120 with Tina Okonkwo – Excel for Data Analytics (Continuation)

Still on Excel today.

Today’s focus was going deeper into functions that actually make Excel feel powerful instead of just convenient.

## 1. Array Formulas

I explored what array formulas are and the difference between classic and modern arrays.

Classic array formulas require special input and feel more rigid. Modern dynamic arrays automatically “spill” results across cells, which makes working with datasets more flexible and efficient.

Functions I practiced:

- `UNIQUE` – Extracts distinct values from a dataset.
- `SORT` – Organizes data in ascending or descending order dynamically.
- `MEDIAN` – Helps measure central tendency without being skewed by outliers.
- `IF` – Applies logical conditions to return different results based on criteria.
- `SUMPRODUCT` – Performs calculations across multiple ranges without needing helper columns.

This made Excel feel more like a calculation engine rather than just a grid.

## 2. Lookup Functions

Lookup functions are used to search for specific values in a dataset and return related information.

The key takeaway was how important data structure is. Well-organized tables make lookups efficient and predictable. Poor structure makes them frustrating.

Understanding lookup logic is critical for connecting datasets.

## 3. Text Functions

Real-world data is rarely clean. Text functions help manipulate and clean string data.

Functions practiced:

- `TEXTJOIN` – Combines text from multiple cells with a specified delimiter.
- `FIND` – Locates the position of a specific character or substring.
- `MID` – Extracts a portion of text from within a string.

These functions highlighted how much preprocessing often happens before actual analysis begins.

## 4. Date and Time Functions

Dates and times are essential in analysis, especially for tracking trends.

Date functions:
- `DAY` – Extracts the day from a date.
- `DATE` – Creates a date from year, month, and day components.

Time functions:
- `HOUR` – Extracts the hour from a time value.
- `TIME` – Creates a time value from hour, minute, and second components.

Breaking dates and times into parts makes time-based analysis more structured and intentional.

Nothing flashy today — just strengthening foundations.

Excel is starting to feel less like a spreadsheet tool and more like a logic tool.
