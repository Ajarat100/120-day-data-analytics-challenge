# Day 16 – Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts in Excel

## Overview

Today I focused entirely on Pivot Tables as part of my Excel for Data Analytics journey.

After building a dashboard on Day 15, this felt like strengthening the core analytical engine behind summaries and visualizations.

## Pivot Table – Introduction

### What is a Pivot Table?

A pivot table is a tool that restructures raw data into summarized insights without altering the original dataset.

It allows you to:
- Aggregate values (sum, average, count, etc.)
- Rearrange categories
- Compare groups quickly
- Drill down into details

Instead of writing formulas for each condition, pivot tables summarize data dynamically.

---

## Why Pivot Tables Are Important

Pivot tables are powerful because they:

- Turn thousands of rows into structured summaries
- Allow fast comparison across categories
- Support hierarchical breakdowns
- Connect directly to pivot charts for visualization

They reduce complexity and make exploratory analysis easier.

## Practical Work – Basic Pivot Table Analysis

### 1. Calculating Average Salary

Using the PivotTable Analyze tab, I:
- Dragged job titles into rows
- Placed salary into values
- Changed aggregation from Sum to Average

This allowed me to compare average salaries by job title.

---

### 2. Layout Changes (Design Tab)

I experimented with:
- Compact layout
- Tabular layout
- Report layout adjustments

Changing layout affects readability and clarity, especially when sharing analysis.

---

### 3. Monthly Job Count by Job Title

Using job_posted_date, I:
- Counted job postings
- Grouped them by month
- Compared trends across job titles

This showed how demand fluctuates over time.

## Pivot Table – Advanced Concepts

### 1. Hierarchies

I analyzed:
- Salary by Country
- Then drilled down into Job Title within each country

This layered structure helps identify patterns across regions and roles.

---

### 2. Automatic Grouping

Excel automatically grouped dates into months and years.

This simplifies time-based analysis without extra formulas.

---

### 3. Manual Grouping

I manually grouped selected job titles into clusters.

This helps when categories need custom grouping beyond raw data labels.

---

### 4. Percent Calculations

I calculated:
- Percent of Grand Total
- Percent of Job Title

This shifted the analysis from raw counts to proportional insight, making comparisons clearer.

---

## Pivot Charts & Slicers

I built:

- A Top Paying Jobs chart
- A Highest Job Demand chart
- A Monthly Job Count chart

Then I connected slicers to allow dynamic filtering.

This made the charts interactive and responsive to category selection.

## Reflection

Day 16 reinforced something important:

Formulas require building logic step-by-step.

Pivot tables allow restructuring data to see patterns quickly.

I am starting to move from calculating numbers to organizing insights.

That feels like progress.
