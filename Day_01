## Reflections

Today was all about building the foundation. Understanding what data really is, its types, and why it matters made me realize how much I used to overlook.  

Learning about the data analyst workflow clicked for me — seeing how asking the right questions, cleaning data, analyzing it, and sharing insights all connect made the role feel concrete and structured.  

The most eye-opening part was realizing how critical the “before analysis” stage is. Good data and clear questions are just as important as the analysis itself.  

It’s only Day 1, but I already see how important it is to go step by step and not rush ahead. I’m curious to see how this foundation will shape the days ahead.
